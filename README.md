**Work Experience:**
- **Sugar Labs (Summer 2023):**
   - Currently working on the “Sugarizer” project in a collaborative effort with SugarLabs under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lionel Laske.
   - Using Vue Js, for creating newer applications for future adaptibitiy, Converted the entire framework from webL10n to i18next, changing the sugarizer-server code to GO Frameworks with docker implementation.

- **Girl Script Summer of Code (2022-2023):**
   - Developed frameworks for ML apps like ImagineAI, improving standard of prompt quality and consistency across different competencies, adhering to established guidelines and best practices.
   - Developed full app along with the image classification for large, medium and small sized images.

**Technical Projects:**
- **LFX Metrics (University Project):**
   - A project which provides Data about every Foundations which gets selected in Linux Foundation Mentorship in every term, gives every statistical data about it and provide a seamless experience for user, so that they don’t get confused and can select the projects they want to work on depending upon their convinient Tech Stack or based on the Foundation.
   - The backend for this project has been made on Golang and the frontend on Astro, a lot of data was scrapped for each foundation, for this the DataBase Management System used is Postgre SQL.

- **NES Emulator (University Project):**
   - A NES Emulator, with all the Operational Codes is built which can work on many devices simultaneously, the complete archietecture has been built from scratch, the MicroProcesser is also built in the same way
   - This project is not built using C++, rather being built using Rust, since it’s a lot faster like being 100 times faster than C++ and like 10 times faster than Go. This makes it more efficient and effective to work with.

**Extracurriculars:**
- **Hackathon Enthusiast:**
   - Actively participated in local and regional hackathons, collaborating with diverse teams to solve real-world problems.
   - Won the "Best Innovation" award at the City Tech Hackathon (2021) for a healthcare application prototype.

- **STEM Outreach Volunteer:**
   - Volunteered at local schools to promote STEM education, conducting coding workshops for middle school students.
