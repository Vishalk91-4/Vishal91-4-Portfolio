**Work Experience:**
- **Sugar Labs (Summer 2023):**
   - Currently working on the “Sugarizer” project in a collaborative effort with SugarLabs under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lionel Laske.
   - Using Vue Js, for creating newer applications for future adaptibitiy, Converted the entire framework from webL10n to i18next, changing the sugarizer-server code to GO Frameworks with docker implementation.

- **Girl Script Summer of Code (2022-2023):**
   - Developed frameworks for ML apps like ImagineAI, improving standard of prompt quality and consistency across different competencies, adhering to established guidelines and best practices.
   - Developed full app along with the image classification for large, medium and small sized images.

**Technical Projects:**
- **LFX Metrics (University Project):**
   - A project which provides Data about every Foundations which gets selected in Linux Foundation Mentorship in every term, gives every statistical data about it and provide a seamless experience for user, so that they don’t get confused and can select the projects they want to work on depending upon their convinient Tech Stack or based on the Foundation.

- **NES Emulator (University Project):**
   - A NES Emulator, with all the Operational Codes is built which can work on many devices simultaneously, the complete archietecture has been built from scratch, the MicroProcesser is also built in the same way

- **ENV NPM Package (Personel Project):**
     - Publishing a NPM Package, which easily stores your API Key in dotenv file, when it is installed, using npm command, it checks using AI, whether the API Key is present or not and stores the same, asking if we want to store it in the same variable or rename to your choice.

- **Image Detection Transformer (Personel Project):**
   - An image classifier that combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers to improve image recognition capabilities.
   - This model can classify images more accurately and can be a valuable tool for tasks like sorting images or detecting objects in a simple yet efficient manner.
